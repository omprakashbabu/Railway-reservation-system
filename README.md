RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM
PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
The railway reservation system is a software application that enables passengers to
book train tickets online or through ticket counters. The system should be designed
to handle a large number of simultaneous requests from users and provide a
seamless booking experience. The system should also allow users to check train
schedules, availability of seats, fares, and cancellation/refund policies.
The railway reservation system should be able to handle the following functionalities:
1. User registration and login: Users should be able to create a new account by
providing their personal details, such as name, email, phone number, and password.
They should also be able to log in using their credentials.
2. Train search and booking: Users should be able to search for trains based on
the source and destination locations, date of travel, and class of travel. They should
also be able to view the availability of seats and fares for each train and book tickets
online. The system should also allow users to cancel their tickets and process
refunds.
3. Payment gateway integration: The system should be integrated with a payment gateway
to enable users to make online payments securely. The system should support multiple
payment modes, such as credit/debit cards, net banking, and e-wallets.
4. Admin functionalities: The system should have a separate admin panel to manage train
schedules, seat availability, fares, and cancellation policies. The admin should also be able to
generate reports and analytics related to ticket sales, revenue, and passenger statistics.
5. Security and scalability: The system should be designed with robust security measures to prevent
unauthorized access and protect user data. It should also be scalable to handle a large number of
simultaneous requests during peak hours.
Overall, the railway reservation system should be user-friendly, reliable, and efficient in handling
ticket booking requests, cancellations, and refunds.
